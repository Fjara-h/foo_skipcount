# foo_skipcount

Track skip statistics for [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/), [official component page](https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_skipcount)

The custom column patterns are %skip_count%, %latest_skip%, %oldest_skip%, %skip_times_raw%, and %skip_times_js%.%first_skip% and %last_skip% are also supported, but may be subject to removal in the future.

Runs on Foobar2000 32-bit, 64-bit and legacy Foobar2000 1.5/1.6.

# Build notes
