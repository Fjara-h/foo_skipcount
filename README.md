# foo_skipcount

Track skip statistics for foobar2000

Only the x64 version for V2 has been confirmed to work at the moment, I am in the processing of making it function for x86 and I will be looking into trying to make one for 1.6 and verifying ARM.

# Build notes

Install MFC to build.


Note: This is my first foobar2000 component and first c++ in a decade, feel free to pull request or open an issue with requests for fixes or improvements.
